# Ordering System documentacion

## Project description

Ordering System is a project built using Spring Boot, Spring Web, JPA, PostgreSQL, Maven, Lombok, and logging using @Slf4j annotations. This project aims to provide a RESTful API to manage the product ordering system.

The technologies and libraries used in this project include:

- Spring Boot: A Java framework used to build Spring-based applications in an easier and faster way. Spring Boot provides automatic configuration and simplifies the development of Spring-based applications.

- Spring Web: Spring module used to develop web applications using RESTful API architecture. Spring Web provides features such as routing, HTTP request processing, and HTTP response delivery.

- JPA (Java Persistence API): A technology used to manage objects in a database using the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) approach. JPA eases the development of database applications by abstracting interactions with relational databases.

- PostgreSQL: A relational database management system used as data storage in this project. PostgreSQL provides powerful features and good scalability.

- Maven: A project management tool used to manage dependencies, build projects, and manage the overall project lifecycle. Maven simplifies the development process and ensures project dependencies can be managed easily.
  
- Lombok: A Java library that reduces the writing of boilerplate code by automatically generating getter, setter, constructor, etc. code through annotations. Lombok increases developer productivity by reducing repetitive code writing.

- Slf4j: A logging library for Java that provides a common interface (API) to interact with various logging frameworks such as Logback, Log4j, and others. Slf4j allows developers to use a common interface independent of specific logging implementations.

This Ordering System project uses Spring Web to develop a RESTful API that allows clients to interact with the ordering system. Through this API, users can create new orders, manage products and customers, calculate the total price of the order, and so on.

By using the above-mentioned technologies, this project can be developed quickly and efficiently and provides the convenience of managing a reliable and scalable ordering system.
